## Understanding Astro Content Collections

Content Collections are Astro's way of organizing and validating your content with TypeScript. Each collection has a defined schema that ensures your content has the required fields and correct data types.

### Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors before they reach production
- **Auto-completion**: Get IntelliSense in your editor
- **Validation**: Ensure content meets requirements
- **Performance**: Optimized content loading
- **Organization**: Clear structure for your content

### Collection Locations

All content lives in `src/content/` with each collection in its own folder:

```
src/content/
├── about/        # Single about page
├── blog/         # Blog posts (.md or .mdx)
├── education/    # Education history
├── hackathons/   # Hackathon entries
├── projects/     # Portfolio projects
└── work/         # Work experience
```

## Content Collection Schemas

Each collection has a specific schema defined in `src/content.config.ts`. All content files must include frontmatter (YAML between `---` markers) that matches the schema.

### About Collection

**Purpose**: Your personal bio and introduction

**File**: `src/content/about/about.md`

**Schema**:
```yaml
---
title: string              # Section title
photo?: string            # Optional photo URL
---
```

**Example**:
```markdown
---
title: "About Me"
photo: "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
---

I'm a passionate developer who loves building beautiful web experiences.
I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and have a keen eye for design.

## What I Do

- Full-stack web development
- UI/UX design
- Open-source contributions

## Interests

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing
to open source projects, or sharing knowledge through blog posts and talks.
```

**Tips**:
- Use the photo field for a professional headshot or avatar
- Write in first person for a personal touch
- Include markdown formatting for better readability
- Highlight your unique skills and interests

---

### Blog Collection

**Purpose**: Articles, tutorials, and blog posts

**Location**: `src/content/blog/*.{md,mdx}`

**Schema**:
```yaml
---
title: string                    # Post title
description: string              # Brief summary (for SEO)
image: image()                   # Featured image (relative path)
publishDate: date                # Publication date
updatedDate?: date              # Optional last update date
tags?: string[]                 # Optional tags/categories
---
```

**Example**:
```markdown
---
title: "Building Modern Web Apps with Astro"
description: "Learn how to create fast, content-focused websites using Astro's islands architecture."
image: "./astro-tutorial.png"
publishDate: "2024-01-15"
updatedDate: "2024-01-20"
tags: ["Astro", "Tutorial", "Web Development"]

# Building Modern Web Apps with Astro

Astro is a revolutionary framework for building content-focused websites...

## Why Astro?

Astro brings several advantages to modern web development:
- Zero JavaScript by default
- Component islands architecture
- Framework-agnostic components
- Excellent performance

## Getting Started

Let's dive into creating your first Astro project...
```

**Image Paths**:
- Use relative paths (`./image.png`) for images in the same folder as your markdown file
- Images are automatically optimized by Astro
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WEBP, AVIF, SVG

**Best Practices**:
- Write compelling titles that encourage clicks
- Keep descriptions under 160 characters for SEO
- Use 2-5 relevant tags per post
- Include `updatedDate` when making significant changes
- Optimize images before adding (aim for < 1MB)

### Projects Collection

**Purpose**: Showcase your portfolio work

**Location**: `src/content/projects/*.md`

**Schema**:
```yaml
---
title: string                    # Project name
description: string              # Brief description
image: image()                   # Project screenshot
startDate: date                  # When you started
endDate?: date                  # When finished (omit for ongoing)
skills: string[]                # Technologies used
demoLink?: string               # Optional demo URL
sourceLink?: string             # Optional source code URL
---
```

**Example**:
```markdown
---
title: "E-Commerce Platform"
description: "A full-stack e-commerce platform with React and Node.js"
image: "./ecommerce-screenshot.png"
startDate: "2023-01-15"
endDate: "2023-06-30"
skills: ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "Stripe", "Tailwind CSS"]
demoLink: "https://demo.myproject.com"
sourceLink: "https://github.com/username/project"
---

## Overview

Built a complete e-commerce solution with user authentication, product catalog,
shopping cart, and payment processing.

## Key Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Product search and filtering
- Shopping cart with session persistence
- Stripe payment integration
- Admin dashboard for inventory management

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
The backend is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing PostgreSQL for data
persistence. User authentication is handled through JWT tokens with refresh
token rotation for enhanced security.

### Frontend
React with TypeScript provides a type-safe development experience. State
management is handled with Context API and custom hooks for cleaner code.

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was implementing real-time inventory updates across
multiple user sessions. I solved this by implementing WebSocket connections
for live updates and optimistic UI updates for better user experience.

## Results

- 500+ active users within first month
- 99.9% uptime
- Average page load time < 2 seconds
```

**Tips for Great Project Descriptions**:
- Start with a clear overview
- Explain the problem you solved
- Highlight technical challenges and solutions
- Include measurable results when possible
- Use headings to organize content
- Add screenshots or demos if available

**Skills Array**:
- List technologies in order of prominence
- Include frameworks, libraries, and tools
- Be specific (e.g., "React 18" vs just "React")
- Limit to 5-8 key technologies

**Ongoing Projects**:
- Omit `endDate` for projects still in development
- The UI will automatically show "Present"

## Best Practices

### File Naming

Use descriptive, URL-friendly names:

**Good**:
- `building-modern-web-apps.md`
- `react-performance-tips.mdx`
- `ecommerce-platform.md`

**Avoid**:
- `post1.md` (not descriptive)
- `New Project.md` (spaces)
- `article_2024.md` (underscores)

### Date Formatting

Always use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

```yaml
publishDate: "2024-01-25"
startDate: "2023-06-15"
```

### Consistent Frontmatter

- Always include all required fields
- Use consistent date formats
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Choose relevant, searchable tags
- Provide meaningful titles

### Image Organization

Keep images organized in the same folder as content:

```
src/content/blog/
├── my-first-post.md
├── my-first-post-hero.png
├── my-first-post-diagram.png
└── another-post.md
```

Reference with relative paths:
```yaml
image: "./my-first-post-hero.png"
```

### Content Quality

1. **Proofread**: Check for typos and grammar
2. **Structure**: Use clear headings and sections
3. **Brevity**: Be concise but thorough
4. **Examples**: Include code examples when relevant
5. **Links**: Verify all links work correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Frontmatter Validation Errors

**Error**: "Required property missing"
- Check `src/content.config.ts` for required fields
- Ensure all required fields are present in frontmatter
- Verify field names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Error**: "Invalid date format"
- Use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Ensure dates are quoted: `"2024-01-25"`
- Check for typos in dates

### Images Not Loading

1. **Check path**: Ensure path is correct relative to markdown file
2. **File extension**: Include extension (.png, .jpg, etc.)
3. **Case sensitivity**: Match exact case of filename
4. **Build cache**: Try deleting `dist/` and rebuilding

### Type Errors

If TypeScript shows errors in content:
- Run `npm run astro check` to see detailed errors
- Verify schema matches your frontmatter
- Check that array fields use proper syntax: `["item1", "item2"]`

## Next Steps

Now that you understand content collections:

1. **Start Creating**: Add your projects, work experience, and education
2. **Write Blog Posts**: Share your knowledge and experiences
3. **Optimize Images**: Use compressed, optimized images
4. **Check the [Markdown Guide](/blog/guides/markdown-guide)**: Learn markdown syntax and formatting

For setup and configuration, see the [Bloomfolio Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide).

Happy creating! 🌼
