# Introduction & Installation

Cadence is the name of a company. In the context of IC design, the term "Cadence" typically refers to the company's integrated circuit design platform, " **Cadence IC.** " Sometimes, it specifically denotes the EDA environment within that platform known as "**Virtuoso Studio.**"

>To draw an analogy, Cadence IC is like the Microsoft Office suite, and Virtuoso Studio is akin to PowerPoint within that suite.
